- Donors can donate blood at campsites or blood banks.
- Information about the donated blood is recorded on the blockchain. A new block of data, including Aadhaar numbers, blood group, blood ID, etc., is appended to the Blood Store.
- The blood is then taken to the blood inspection center, where it is declared as 'Tested and Safe' or 'Tested and Unsafe'.
- A QR code, which is a combination of Aadhaar numbers, blood ID, and Batch number's hash, is generated and attached to the blood packets.
- Donors are notified about the acceptance or discarding of their blood.
- 'Tested and Safe' blood is made available for patients.
- Hospitals can specify the required blood group and the patient‚Äôs Aadhaar number to maintain accountability and prevent fraud.
- An algorithm searches for the optimal blood bank based on proximity and blood availability.
- Blood is transferred from the selected blood bank to the hospital.
- Hospitals can view details of the received blood virtually and verify the physical blood by uploading the QR code.
- Hospitals and blood banks can log in with an email and admin-provided password, and all transactions are verified with a MetaMask wallet.
- Blood donors can track their blood history without logging in, using their Aadhaar number and blood ID.

## Conclusion:

- The blockchain-based solution ensures visibility through traceability.
- QR code authentication and encrypted transactions ensure blood integrity.
- The optimization algorithm ensures blood availability in hospitals at all times.
- Blood scarcity during emergencies is eliminated.
- Traditional system transparency issues are resolved.
